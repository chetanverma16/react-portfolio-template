I'm Pamela, a certified yoga teacher and sound healer. My journey into yoga began in 2016, leading to a profound exploration of movement and self-discovery. I am particularly passionate about Ashtanga and Yin practices, which I teach to help others find their own balance and tranquility. My classes emphasize the importance of free movement and dance, allowing for a holistic approach to well-being. Additionally, I incorporate sound healing techniques to enhance relaxation and mindfulness during sessions. My goal is to inspire others in the yoga community to embrace their personal journeys towards balance and freedom through movement.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹  I'm a software engineer, product designer.","description":"I have delivered world-class user experiences to millions of people.
